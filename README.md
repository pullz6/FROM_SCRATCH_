# Random Forest From Scratch

Welcome to this series where we code popular machine learning alogirthims from scratch, episode 2. We will be creating a Random Forest from scratch. We will see if we can create a Random Forest to see if we can predict early hair loss.

## Project Overview

Objectives in this repo is the below: 

- To understand the inner working of the random forest
- To understand how to code the inner workings 
- To apply it for an existing dataset 

---

## Data

- We leveraged the hair loss dataset in Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukexun/luke-hair-loss-dataset 

---

## Installation

1. This was completed using a Google Colab, you ca replicate it similarly inside Google Colab or as a Jupyter Notebook. 


## Acknowledgments

Thank you to https://carbonati.github.io/posts/random-forests-from-scratch/ for the code and explanation that allowed me to understand the random forest and how to implement the code.
